The Tech

This project uses a mathematical system known as a Markov Chain that can describe abstract and discrete points. Which is really a lot of bullshit that means we can randomly select a set of words, then based on those words, pick another set of words which generally follows the last word in a large body of text.

In order to make the sentences sound (slightly) more natural we collected thousands of greek life students' forum posts from Collegiate ACB. Based on this large model, we are able to generate fairly diverse and mostly hilarious range of sentences.

We built upon an open source Markov Generator to create the sentences in the style of frat boys and sorority girls.

The Styling

We collected various styling blocks from all over the interwebz and used them here:
