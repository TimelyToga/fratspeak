var corpus = "pike, you stupid fucking \”titanic\”, you are suppose to suggest a name of an actual movie for the name of your last dump. follow along asshole, instead of annoying everyone else as usual. APhi looks so retardedly desperate. GIRLYS, pls stop trying so so hard. its embarrassing for everyone to see you like this. they seriously need to learn that hyping themselves on collegiate acb won\’t make up for their subpar pledge class Aphi\’s self promotion is actually pathetic and getting annoying aphi you can post here all you want, but every sorority on campus knows that your pc is full of girls that were blacklisted everywhere else Please, lets not clutter this site with irrelevant material outside of its purpose. Okay, so is pike the gayest fraternity at Duke Pike is actually the only frat without an openly gay kid… Even if that were true, which we all know it is not, then pike still is the undisputed home of the most effeminate guys on campus. Hands down. No one else is even close, which is why they are sooo active on this site, gossiping like a bunch whinny high school girls. Actual, yes that is why they purportedly mix with them - to braid each other\’s hair, trade tips on leg shaving, and compare thong underwear. which organization is gayer pike or Duke LGBT? A: Pike because it wins most of the cross rushes It\’s not that they\’re particularly bad, but ever since rush they\’ve been talking themselves up so much. Actions speak louder than words and at the moment their actions really aren\’t saying much for them They gave bids to everyone with a dick and friends that are girls. We have ten to fifteen legitimately cool kids, but the rest of our fraternity is filled with grade A bozos. Actually, I like a lot of these guys and have been to their parties. Both iced out and inferno were fun. I would put these guys even with, or just above, ADphi or Snu and predict a pledge class of 25 to 30 lacrosse, football and bball players. There are definitely a few decent guys but the weird ones more than make up for it. Trending up above KSig and SigEp but that\’s optimistic Actually, I would put DTD back on par with PiKapp or ATO. At this point, they clearly seem to have fully recovered from their hazing debacle two years ago. BUMP for hilariousness. This is the biggest joke I\’ve seen since, well, KSig. dtd\’s iced out party was probably in the top three best parties of last semester and, so far, inferno is the best party I\’ve been to this semester. in my view, they do a great job with their parties. I don\’t know many of the brothers but I like the ones I do know. This is the saddest attempt at self-promotion I\’ve seen in a while. Keep at it, boys Beware- this is the type of sister you will get if you join theta. She is a careless, manipulative, wreckless human being. Your presence in ACB is so fucking pathetic. You guys are literally the only ones who would talk about yourselves, so no one really gives a fuck. Having a big pledge class of fucking losers who were so close to becoming a gdi is not something to brag about. Don\’t you dare compare yourselves to pikapp and know your fucking place. Pike is hands down better than DTD, it\’s not even close. DTD shutup. You guys are a bunch of boners. Yes, pike is \”hands down better\” because its the gentleman\’s fraternity. All us key-three\’s just swoon for their suave, sensitive discourse. Everyone knows that no one in Pike would make or even comment on this thread. Clearly DTD trying to make themselves seem like they\’re on the same tier by creating this. Congratulations to the ATO acb committee for making it seem like they got a sick pledge class this year and are now on the same level as pike and pushing hard for tier 1. The reality is they actually moved down a tier and are solidly behind both pike and pikapp and probably are 4 full years of good pc\’s from tier 1. Yes ATO got 28 kids, but 90% of them were tier 3 kids at best. Yes they took 1 sophomore who got a bid to both pike and KA, but that was because they also took his lame friend, which pike and KA refused to do because he is a fucking loser. Both pike and pikapp took all of the other kids ATO wanted during round 2 and 3. ATO needed numbers after snap bidding most of their classes the last two years so they were willing to take any kid no matter how lame. Nobody in tier 1 or 2 is jealous of the class ATO got or would have given a bid to more then 2 of the kids they got. Here is a real example of how lame these kids are: several freshman ATO kids were on the bus talking about a fifths and shackles date function. The conversation was about how they didn\’t want to bring fifths because they would end up throwing up from drinking to much so instead they were going to bring wine. What a bunch of lame ass pussies. Another example: we cut one of the ATO freshman first round for creeping out the girls who were taking the freshman pictures. He then hit up our rush chairs begging to be given another chance and said he would pay for all of the alcohol for our first round 2 event. Fucking pathetic So enjoy the first round of mixers ATO because after the sororities see the pathetic excuse for tier 1 and 2 rejects you pulled in they will not want to mix again. My apologies, calling these kids tier 1 and 2 rejects is insulting to those kids. This post might seem sensationalized or rude, but if you talk to any tier 1 or 2 guy who was on the their fraternities rush board they will tell you the exact same thing about the ATO freshman pc Yikes. Majority of the kids I know in the Pikapp class got cut from ATO. ATO\’s class is nowhere near top tier but their freshman class is easily ahead of Pikapp\’s Keep telling yourself anything that makes you feel better about your shit pledge class, guys. Uh, everyone has different opinions, but the result is we mix with key 3 and pikapp doesn\’t. jajajajaja go fuck yourself. Half their pc is solid the other half is whack as fuck and didn\’t deserve bids. Yes, they will still mix with good sororities no they are not trending up Jesus christ pike be less obvious. ^Who else would even know that? No one would be so ass hurt over ATO\’s class than you. To be honest no one knows any of the kids in either of your shitty classes but at least ATO isn\’t on here spamming the fuck out of their class like you did last year. Lol seriously, who would know if this is true other than someone in Pike trying to do damage control? Who cares what tier a frat is in or who\’s pledge class is better? Can\’t we all just appreciate the fact we are at Duke and that the whole point of a fraternity is to make lifelong friends and develop as a person not to compare SNu\’s pledge class to KA\’s. The whole \”tiers\” of fraternities are bullshit and someone shouldn\’t be judged by which fraternity they are in. I would have never come to this school had a known how shallow people are here. Agreed a fraternity is to make lifelong friends and that\’s the most important thing. If that happens to be KA good for you but go where you feel you belong. Then again, tiers are always going to be important. they are beyond irrelevant now and will be dead within the next 3 years. embarrassing to aphi that they mixed with them last night. Probably shouldn\’t look to this site for frat advice. Its notoriously bad. There mixers with a phi are most likely slowly going to die down Good group of guys. Got one of the top pc\’s last year but lost momentum because of asia prime. They do still mix with good sororities though. They do mix with good sororities only for now Off campus doesn\’t matter much at all really. They still get girls. A lot of them date and get with key 3\’s on the reg. I\’d just trust your own opinion. Most people on here are frats just shitting on each other. So is ksig a good move or will it end badly? Ksig are a bunch of really cool guys that just got in some trouble. They had one of the top pledge classes last year, and still hang with hot girls. Rumor has it that they are coming back on campus next year. We all say we want change, but we never do anything about. We all want to change the world, but we don\’t even start with ourselves. You guys say sorority and fraternity rankings are dumb, but yet you guys don\’t go out of the way to meet members from other organizations. Some SNU\’s might think girls from a lower sorority or a GDI are attractive, but they would never invite them to a party. Some ZTA\’s might think guys from DSIG are hot, but they would never crush them for their crush party. Actually these groups do interact. Check your facts before you contribute to stereotypes yourself. If you banged her, report in Well the duke scandal clock has obviously run out, this is going to be a shitstorm. doubt that girl makes it through the semester. we going to pretend like she was unaware of the social consequences of going into that business? she made a decision, now she needs to live with the consequences. yeah, on the other hand she\’s presumably still a teenager, not sure that she had a completely accurate idea of the consequences. totally fascinating from a coldly sociopathic point of view. yeah, on the other hand she\’s presumably still a teenager, not sure that she had a completely accurate idea of the consequences. totally fascinating from a coldly sociopathic point of view. here was a porn scene from a website where a girl was wearing a Duke shirt. The link to the scene was posted here for a while. But that girl doesn\’t go here. hmm considering i just saw a video of this girl getting fucked while spitting on her reflection i\’m prettty sure youre wrong How about you go to GA and just talk to her? Maybe that\’ll convince you of her existence... Hey this is the girl you\’re talking about. If you actually asked me about my story, you would know I did it because I needed to pay tuition and didn\’t want to go into debt to do so, and I very much enjoy doing it. And as far as making fun of me for being a feminist: I plan to use my experiences to someday be an activist for sex workers. You guys are horrible fucking people. Get a life beyond harassing me from the comfort of your computer screen. no one in this thread has called her stupid or a slut. they have just mentioned she does porn. one person makes a comment about feminists in general, and two people agree that doing porn has repercussions. still unclear. So being choked, spit on and degraded is now empowering? She has sex on camera. Big fucking deal. People here do heroin. I\’d rather fuck for money. dunno. we gonna pretend that we\’re not the people who get to decide what those consequences are? Dont make a problem, wont be a problem. Frankly I feel sorry for her; not because of the porn, but because of how much clumsy dumbfuck bro bullshit she\’s going to have to put up with, like a bad movie mashup between Easy A and 40 year old virgin. These will be the same people who after \’having fun\’ in their 20s will look at their sagging bodies and sexual appeal and wonder why no one will marry them To be honest, I\’m a little uncomfortable because I\’m actually jealous on the inside. I know that I\’ve got a lot of great things going for me, so I\’m trying to rationalize and feel \”superior\” to this girl who has \”clearly made a bad choice\” but on the inside, I\’m alone. I\’m a single guy and I\’d really love to have awesome hot sex and I wish I had more sex with various women by this time. Just because she enjoys it doesn\’t mean it\’s not degrading. If you think a woman should live her life always mindful of whether what she wants will interfere with YOUR values of \’marriage material\’ is, then congratulations : You\’re a misogynistic piece of shit. It only looks like a high horse because everyone else is lying in the shit. You don\’t have to like her decisions. You do have to respect them ; because they don\’t affect you in any way whatsoever. You\’ll live your life in the way you think is best. So will she. Expecting someone else to censor their behavior to coddle your \’comfort\’ is fucking asinine. Expecting that your opinion will be taken seriously, or bears any weight because you are \”offended\” or \”uncomfortable\” or because \”I wouldnt marry a porn star\” is fucking laughable. By YOUR moral and sexual standards, it is degrading and repulsive. But objectively, is it degrading for a woman to fully choose and consent to engage in BDSM play? She wasn\’t forced into doing anything. Everyone has different fantasies and fetishes... who are you to judge as long as everything is consensual and legal? No I don\’t. I also don\’t respect people who abuse drugs. It doesn\’t affect me in any way whatsoever, and yet I still don\’t have respect for drug abusers. I don\’t ask her to censor her behavior. I\’m just making fun of her for being a huge slut. I don\’t really expect to be taken seriously, at least no more seriously than a girl who\’s had strangers jizz on her face and slap her. I\’m not treating her like she\’s \”not a human being.\” On the contrary, I\’m treating her like a human being by holding her accountable for (really stupid) actions. Do you really believe, in the age of the internet where any info you want is available with a few clicks, that her kids won\’t find that video? Do you really think that her kids won\’t see their mother getting held down and cummed on by strangers 3 decades her elder? If you think that is healthy or liberating or empowering, you have bigger problems that I can\’t help you with. the consequences of her actions? She won\’t be drowning in student loans, she loves her job, and she feels comfortable with her identity and sexuality. seems to me like the only consequences are being harassed by assholes like you who choose to marginalize her based on her completely legal and legitamate choices. that\’s such a stupid argument. maybe YOU would have an issue with your children seeing that, but maybe she would like to raise her children in a sex positive household where she could have open discussions with them about sex and sexuality . Maybe you should stop jumping to conclusions? Or projecting your moral beliefs on her? Hahahaha if a sex positive household includes watching my mother get nailed, I\’ll pass. Can we all please take a break from this topic and go back to exposing Pike as the gayest fraternity on campus. let\’s give it a rest. hahahaha this is why no one takes feminists seriously, it takes a special kind of crazy to actually buy into this nonsense Can we all agree to just let this die before the media gets it? From an embarrassment standpoint, this is like 10x worse than the lacrosse scandal. You have a point about her being at a school like Duke becoming a story but you want to know where it will end up if anywhere? TFM and maybe barstoolsports. Hardly something to worry about. And I can understand the stigma because the bible says sex is bad or whatever but in all reality how can being involved in an industry that literally creates a form of entertainment that at least 90% of the male population of the industrialized world has watched at some point so \”abnormal?\” You can\’t even get those numbers for video games Someone tried to bury this. Ain\’t gonna happen. This is big fucking news. \”normal gifted people\” that equivocate pornstars and feminists with racists? How many cocks did you suck to get into duke? lolol The most normal ideal is that sex is awesome and people watch that shit. Pretty sure more people watch porn than the superbowl or Game Of Thrones, So what are you really mad about? Is she just getting more cock than you? Who cares if shes\’s done porn. Most people here have sex, and most people masturbate to porn. Why\’s it a big deal that she does that same things, except she gets paid to? God, this school is retarded sometimes, glad I graduated last year, you guys are fuck nuggets (all of you, bros AND hardcore feminists) There\’s no way she\’s going to become a lawyer being a porn star (no law school is going to accept her). Seriously, she needs to get over herself and face the consequences of being a slut. I\’ll be surprised if Duke doesn\’t kick her out. and you look like a jealous asshole who spends their weekend bashing on someone they don\’t even know from behind a computer screen. She\’s still not getting into law school. She\’s part of Cru? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL Such as who they mix with, what the brothers are like, etc. I\’ve heard that most of the brothers are jewish mixes with dg, adpi, alpha phi, and zeta alpha phi has never mixed with aepi and dg and zeta did so once each in the last year and never again due to low attendence A lot of my sisters and I love them. Sure they might not be the most popular guys on campus, but their date functions and parties are always fun. We never feel creeped on by any of the brothers and they\’re respectful instead of trying to have sex with us five minutes after they meet us. I always see a ton of ADPis, Zetas, and a decent number of Phis there too. I don\’t know if they actually mix with Zeta/Aphi, but they definitely have many friends in a variety of sororities. So what differentiates them from DTD/SigEp? Besides that they\’re jewish? give aphi a semester to realize theyre not core four just because theyre all over acb and theyll be mixing with aepi again. wouldnt be surprised to see theta mix with them in the next year either. coming from a girl in one of the sororities that mixes with aepi, i can say that while they aren\’t the broiest of guys, I have more fun at their mixers than I do at some of the \”upper tier\” mixers we have. DG and zeta and adpi will absolutely continue to mix with them as always, can\’t say too much about aphi but i know theyve at least one aphi mixer most semesters And by \”date\” I mean \”have sex with\” Depends on the type of birth control used. well, if you has a choice, its probably safer to go with a girl who is pro-choice. accidents happen. ^ a question to ask before having sex she better be on those pills then They got 31 pledges compared to ADPhis 15. There\’s not a severe drop in quality. What\’s the deal with the hate? Literally heard the fattest and ugliest kid I\’ve seen at the school say he went Snu last night These are genuinely the weirdest kids I\’ve ever seen go top tier. They got cut first round from other places. I swear to god, with 3 or 4 exceptions out of the 31, if you talked to these kids you would assume they\’re in like PiKapp at best. Number is meaningless. I actually feel badly for the older guys in snu to see the type of kids who are going to be their brothers this year. probably cause snu could get 100 pledges and still suck lol at the persisting sig chi presence on this website Who does DTD even mix with besides Zeta and why are people pretending they\’re relevant? DTD all over this site. Get a life losers Come on SigEp, give a rest. We get it, you want to be thought of as better than DTD. ^^^ all of these posts are by sigma chi, fuking LOL at trying to pretend other fraternities are posting shit about each other on here excuse me. I would like to combat a few misconceptions about the negative stigma associated with chi omega. We have no reason whatsoever to shut down our chapter or get kicked off of campus. We have high gpa\’s, lots of awards, nationals love us because we never get fined, and duke loves us because we do not get into any trouble at all. I understand that people honestly do not care much for our organization, but we have a lot of good quality girls. It is so annoying when I introduce myself to someone and when I casually mention I\’m a ChiO, that person is like \”really? you? you don\’t seem it. why are you hanging out with them? are you a legacy?\” I\’m tall, fit, and pretty and I remember preffing ChiO each round even though I was getting dirty rushed by other sororities because I valued their honesty Lots of our sisters go to SigChi, SAE, SigEp, DTD, Pikapp, ATO, and Pike parties. Then there are a couple of us that literally like to lock themselves up in a cubicle and do homework. sorry you meet the one or two shorter/fatter/uglier people and judge all of us from that. We want everybody to wear letters, not just the pretty ones who will give us a good reputation. We do not like hiding away our members. honestly, we don\’t care much for our \”bottom tier\” status, so I am not sure why anybody else does either. We are not threatened by Gphi at all. Even if they rank higher or lower than us, we do not care and we will not care. Plus, our recruitment video was 100x better than TriDelt\’s, ZTA\’s, and ADPi. Get to know us or Don\’t get to know; we\’ll be here doing our own thing for as long as possible. I think this is DSig trying to bash on Pike by mentioning its name on the list of parties ChiO chicks attend. Nice try to be completely truthful, i actually really liked talking to the chi-O girl i met during rush...i do think they\’re in a bad spot though because its one of the two girls talk shit about a lot. one girl in my hall told me she was joining to meet upperclassmen girls but then dropped out after round 3 to join the new sorority because she thought she didn\’t fit in with zeta tau alpha or chi-o...lol what\’s gonna be their reputation? who decides whether a girl gets a bid to a sorority that doesn\’t exist? Fat ugly autistic girls all the girls who thought they were too cool for any of the bottom sororities but it\’s gonna turn out horrible and they\’re gonna be last. congrats chio and zeta, you guys won\’t be the bottom bottom anymore. adpi is moving up: same level as dg. and aphi is above theta, maybe even kappa. Well, obviously better than Chi O.Anyone with enough dignity not to join Chi O would join. Also anyone who dropped because they didn\’t get the sorority they wanted... or people who didn\’t rush and changed their minds.I\’d say ADPi level for sure. When will you girls learn that recruitment videos never, never end well? ^There\’s a huge drop off from the quality of girls at UA and FSU to the quality of Duke girls which plays a pretty big role here, they can get away with it our girls clearly can\’t The tridelts seem to think its funny and don\’t care? ^Some sorority girl is clearly butthurt. I don\’t understand how its creepy to download a video before you expect it to be taken down. I know a ton of people who wanted to see exactly how bad the video was, but it wasn\’t there. You know what I think is creepy? Date rape, which happens all too often at Duke. To be fair it looks like woah devil also uploaded the adpi video so it could really be either. Either way these girls and tridelt too should chill, these videos really aren\’t a big deal, as funny as it is that national outlets are picking this up. Just laugh and move on with your life Thank you everyone on collegiate ACB for bumping us up past the Key 3. Welcome to the new best sorority on campus! Deal with it Theta. You\’re rush sucked and everyone knows it. Alpha Phi has been trending up for a while and is now clearly in the 4th spot. At least you\’re still better than DG (barely). Not going to lie I am currently pretty fucking devastated and I\’m not sure what went wrong. It is tough as hell seeing my friends so excited and asking me about where I\’m joining and I have to tell them I didn\’t get a bid. What are my options at this point? How bad is being an independent? Is it worth joining an SLG (even though I wouldn\’t fit in at all compared to the kids rushing SLGs I know)? Are snap bids a thing and if so where could I still get a bid from? I know it\’s stupid to ask an online resource for advice...but I honestly have nothing to lose at this point. Joining an SLG or being an independent is pretty much signing a contract to never get laid for the rest of your time at Duke. Don\’t do it. Your best bet this year is probably SAE/SigChi, all the other usual suspects (DTD/SigEp/AEPi) got 20+ kids so it\’s doubtful they\’ll really look into taking anyone else and even SAE did pretty decently and was probably hovering at the 15~ mark based off of the number of kids who came in. I would get in contact with their rush chair/president/someone as soon as you can. Best of luck. Truth is, it shouldn\’t matter. Why do you care so much about what other people think? Duke is whatever you make it, and you are not defined by your group of friends. You are not going to get lucky just because you are in a top-rated frat, whatever that is. I never post here, but I looked at your question, and he reminded me of myself back in 2010. I was devastated and I seriously thought there was something fundamentally wrong with myself because I was rejected when all my friends who are objectively not any better than me got into DSIG and SNU. First step is to realize that there is nothing wrong with you. It was just bad luck and it is just how things turned out. Apparently I found out that I was flirting with the social chair\’s ex girlfriend and other stupid stuff like that. 3) Transfer out. This is the easy way out. This is also a wildcard because you might end up in a less prestigious university but you might be happy socially. Not sure, but it has worked out for some people. Mostly agree with the guy above, although I think he\’s a little jaded/pessimistic about your situation. The key to having fun here is just to have a group you feel close with, whether that\’s your fraternity, SLG, or even your freshman friend group. I\’m assuming most/all of your friend group is going Greek, and that fucking sucks for you, I\’m sorry. But there are plenty of opportunities to make friends and you\’ve only just been here for a semester. Look into SAE/SigChi, sure, but don\’t be afraid to hit up Wayne or Maxwell, who are probably the only SLGs that take remotely fratty guys. If those don\’t happen, then join a club, do a club sport or IM sports, or start befriending people in your dorm. And if none of those things happen, there\’s fall rush or you can rush some middle tier fraternities next spring. you\’re such a pussy dude. you didn\’t get a bid because you wouldn\’t have fit in. grow a fucking sack and realize that there are real world problems that make yours look like over toasting a fucking pop tart. adphi gave out less than the quoted 37 bids and was more selective than last year, resulting in their smaller class. besides their senior class, they normally do not have large pledge classes. have some solid dudes this year. snu got a mixture of cool kids and fillers who very much fit their \”image\” and will stay the same. they always rush the hardest and are able to pull a decent class despite the initial hype about a bad rush. Who are the relevant Asians (including Indians) after frat/sorority rush? This is the dumbest fucking post I\’ve seen on this site. Stop implying that most Asians are \”irrelevant\”. This entire frat system is one big white circle jerk. Have fun hiding behind your daddy\’s money while others are actually working to make something for themselves. Honestly there is so much racism and stereotyping on this campus. How the fuck is Duke a top 10 school. Bitches like you are looking for token Asians and blacks and Hispanics and etc just to pretend you\’re diverse. Come live a week with me in the part of the world where I grew up. You wouldn\’t last a single fucking day without your filet mignon and a butler to jack you off. You\’re an ignorant piece of shit and I look forward to rejecting you resume when you apply to work for me 25 years from now. -A Duke Asian who didn\’t get to wipe his ass with Benjamins while growing up. PS if you\’re not white, you\’re a fucking disgrace to colored people Is it just me, or does every single pledge class this year pale in comparison to the previous years? Bump. as duke acceptance percentage goes down, so does the attractiveness of the people that get in oops. after last year\’s seniors graduated, I can\’t name 5 cool kids in the entire frat. they\’re just a bunch of bland, normalish looking white dudes with no personalities. they just needed dues money for their social budget so they took a ton of fillers. I don\’t see this year being any different. don\’t know why anyone would think they\’re top house at duke. they\’re fine but nothing special Two of my sisters and I went looking for an alternate ladies room while we were at Pike\’s Lights party last Wednesday. We opened a door to a back room and came upon two Pike\’s giving each other rim jobs. We asked them what the hell they were doing and they replied they were looking for their keys. Swear on a stack of bibles. ...cool story bro \”Looking for their keys\” is the standard cover story. Actually, they were giving each other the Pike secret hand shake. I walked into that back room too. They told me they were rehearsing for a part in the Human Caterpillar. I have nothing against gays and totally support equality. I also think it is great that pike has embraced having a gay segment in their house. I know some people were turned off that some guy couples were showing public affection toward each at Pike-toberfest but I say go for it, good for them. Holy fucking shit pike, get over your fucking self and your social climbing obsession. You guys are nothing but effeminate gays, and anyone who would consider joining pike is also a gay loser. So freshman: join pike if you want to be known as a girly loser and if you hope to save your virginity until you graduate. faces optional. cock mandatory. will reciprocate Pike may be the worst fraternity at this university. Sure..they have good organization and alot of kids, but every single one of those kids is a loser. Seriously, have you seen these kids? Half look like their faces were bludgeoned by a hammer for hours on end and the other half look like they use to have a twin attached at the face and it was removed but now they have fucking holes in their face. Anyways, what i was saying is that why are these kids cool? I seriously can\’t name a single cool kid or a kid that turned down another fraternity. Seriously, like 10 of kids rushing pike went on to join DTD and SigEP. Every year pike does the same old shit. They find some kids and hang out with them from day one. Of course these kids arent cool but pike is content. And then they get their pledge class of 30 down-syndromed deformed kids and post on this page to make it seem like they do a good job. Okay, i lied. Not all the kids are gay, they get like 2 or 3 out of 30 a year. Pike shows all these kids off while the others are sent back to their cages where they listen to e-book on how to be cool or play world of war craft. Also, why is Pike\’s pledging so unnecessarily tough. Then send kids to like the woods to sleep out for the first week of pledging. They do tons of conditioning and shit, but i guess they do it so their kids can run from the cops after they roofie all the bitches. Its not like their pledging creates brother hood or anything. I know kids in Pike who dont know other kids in pike! During rush i literally had a brother ask me if i was another brother. LOL. Guess the elephant walks and cum swapping doesnt help them at all. Cant wait for the responses about other frats and downvotes and hiding by pike brothers. What im trying to say is. Why join Pike when you can join Adphi. Make sure to come to Jocks at bowling this wednesday!! I used to respect Pike as a unique brotherhood that forged its own identity and didn\’t succumb to the TFM stereotypes. But lately they just seem to be following the pack with their noses up the butts of the alpha dogs in front of them. why would anyone ever use these comments in talking about anyone: \”faces bludgeoned by a hammer,\” \”down-syndromed deformed kids,\” \”loser.\” This post blew my mind... I didn\’t know people still talked about other people like this. Stop bashing on other human beings and making yourself look so cruel and insensitive. Do something else...anything else. dsig this may be an all time low. the only reason your rush is going even semi well is because snu has virtually self destructed ATO\’s had a quiet first round this year, and after the fiasco last rush it\’s almost certain they\’ll be dropping down heavily if it happens again. Hearing freshmen already jumping ship. Similar to the problems happening at KA the past three years. Ksig has more boners than after a high school kid finds his dad\’s playboys. KSig has more boners than ADPhi has truly crippling cocaine addictions KSig has more boners than KA has individual needlepoints in their belts KSig has more boners than Dsig has brothers who do not know how to speak English KSig has more boners than Pike has kids who have been described as \”but he\’s a really nice guy!\” KSig has more boners than Snu has kids rushing them this year KSig has more boners than PiKapp has unused condoms KSig has more boners than Sig Ep has identities KSig has more boners than Theta has spanks KSig has more boners that SAE has empty rooms I am beginning to hear a lot of stories about hazing. Can someone enlighten us? I\’ve heard that most frats haze and that KA is brutal. Is that true? I\’ve have also heard that a handful, including PiKapp and Wayne don\’t haze at all? Is that true? You\’ll find out in a month. Don\’t worry, you\’re fucked regardless. Wayne isn\’t even a fraternity so of course they don\’t haze. Any of the decent frats have pledging, if you look on here you can find some pledging tasks that people have mentioned. Holy shit get over your fucking entitlement complex, freshman. Fucked up? Yeah, pledging blows. Stop expecting some generous upperclassman to come here and be \”helpful\” and guide you through it. It\’s not your fucking business, and the guy who made the cryptic post was at least nice enough to give you something. Shut up, stop expecting to be given the answers, and wait until January to go through it like everybody else. Oh, okay wise upperclassman. Who am I to ask questions. I\’ll try to get over myself. So even though I\’ve heard stories of naked line-ups with one pledge sticking his nose in another ass, I shouldn\’t ask any questions until its my turn. I assume I\’ll be able to figure out who you are on the 4th by the color of your nose. actually you were a little off. we don\’t stick our nose up each other\’s assholes, we use our dicks. it\’s called pledge class bonding. and sometimes the brothers make use do weird shit with dildos. ever heard of any elephant walk? we do the elephant marathon. see you next month! I never said that I \”know exactly what\’s going on\”. To the contrary, I am asking what is the truth. Those stories are wide spread at this point. If you don\’t want to answer a legitimate question, then stick your dick in your brothers ass and let someone else answer. Fuck you dickwad. PiKapp has probably cut back there hazing after getting in a lot of trouble two years ago. They told each of their pledges to fill a condom with their own jizz and then told them they had to drink it. One of the kids understandably freaked out and PiKapp got fucked. Wasn\’t the kid who complained gay? Thought I heard that yep, this is what happens when you bid a bunch of gays...they act like faggots and can\’t handle their shit I\’m okay with drinking, memorization, and occasionally puking since I\’ve been doing that since day one of O-week. Can someone tell me which frats, if any, are a good fit for someone who is pre-med and plays multiple club sports - in other words, doesn\’t have a lot of room for time wasting servitude tasks? Also, regarding the naked line-ups, I understand from multiple u.c. girls that at least one inappropriate photo circulated the year before last. Since I do not want to be in any more inappropriate photos than I already am in, can someone tell which frats are least likely to do that shit.none, this is not a joke you entitled piece of shit, forget about your next semester just focus on getting through it Dude, seriously, it would help the rest of us decipher your dribble if you could kindly take your nose out of your brother\’s ass, open a grammar book and learn how to punctuate a sentence. Since this site is so full of rankings, could someone kindly put together a ranking of fraternities by the degree of hazing - say from 1) brutal ass physical torture and humiliation to 2) to blow-hard grade-school cry-baby threatening nonsense, as exhibited in the prior post? Btw dude, does the reason that you only want to get one \”hand\” on another dude, as opposed to \”my hands\”, have something to do with that elephant dance with the dildo that you seemed so excited about? I think everyone will be in agreement with me here that none of us actually want to get our hands on you, because that would mean giving a bid to you. And if someone who is so blatantly a loser like yourself gets a bid to my fraternity then I will know I\’m in the wrong fraternity. Oh, that really hurts my feelings and I feel so sad. So I won\’t get participate in the elephant dance? coming from an upperclassman girl, you sound like a massive shithead. you don\’t get to pick and choose what kind of hazing you do. that\’s kind of the entire point. picking which frat you join based on how much hazing they do is also probably the worst way to choose. pull your head out of your ass and stop acting so entitled. as a freshman you\’re at the bottom and have to work your way up - just like everyone else Second, if you are a girl then I am a virgin and hope never to have sex again. With all due respect, you sound only slightly more masculine than the alphas at my prep school – which, if you are a girl, I actually find kind of sexy. Perhaps we should pregame together? Third, with regard to hazing, it seems only fair that a guy about to pledge a fraternity should have an idea of what is expected of him, at a minimum, so he can judge whether he will be able to complete pledging while meeting his other obligations – which for me are some pretty meaty premed courses. As with any transaction, I believe that someone seeking a benefit should be allowed to know the cost of that benefit. 100% chance you\’re actually on finaid. Fyi freshman: the obnoxious hazing only occurs in the (self-proclaimed) tier 1 fraternities. The rest are relatively respectful. having read this entire thread, here are some recommendations from a real girl who has been in the greek system for four years: you should check out pike, ATO, PiKapp, Wayne and maybe ADPhi and possibly Sig Ep. also, try exhibiting a little less testosterone; it doesn\’t mix well. mmm nope i am in fact a girl. glad to hear you find my butch language sexy (..?) i know some things about hazing because i\’ve been in the greek community for 2 years and have friends in fraternities which should not be such an alien concept for you to grasp. i\’m sure as shit glad that sororities don\’t haze because i wouldn\’t have been able to deal with that but i understand the theory behind it and most of my guy friends say that it was more or less worth it in the end at this point i figure you\’re either just trying to get a rise out of people or actually are convinced that some frat brother is going to spill about his/others\’ secrets here for the benefit of some random ass freshman acting like a total prick. they keep that stuff pretty close to the chest because obviously they could get in a lot of trouble if any of it gets out. that\’s why even after 2 years i only know a few random tidbits about various frats\’ hazing practices (which i will not bother to repeat for you here) because even my closest friends don\’t like to talk about it at this point i really don\’t know why i\’m wasting my time typing all this besides the fact that i think self-entitled freshmen like you are annoying as shit and need to be taken down a peg. if you\’re that concerned about hazing just join wayne and you can spend your friday nights fingering each others buttholes or whatever wayne does with their free time 1) People are blaming this freshman kid for being entitled when most of the frat guys are the ones who are entitled for thinking they\’re superior for the money their fathers have earned, expecting to hook up with girls just because they threw a party/pregame and getting butthurt if the girls refuse (learn game? because your frat-bullshit will have 0% effect in the real world), and their general superiority over the \”un-cool\” kids. Hazing is a beautiful institution, if you disagree it\’s probably because you\’re a GDI pussy fuck and simply don\’t get it. Hey Freshman, the absolute worst hazing incident occurred last year when an entire pledge class was locked in a classroom with a naked Tri-Delt who only had one layer of makeup on and no implants or nose job. As you can imagine, it was a major puke fest. Remember back in those days when they had progressives? Where the key 3 girls gave blowjobs to the guys who rushed in the themed rooms? And rush was like for more than 3 weeks? It kinda balanced out the pledging back in those days. ATO- Be prepared to drive to VA one night and get a really strange hair cut Pike- Be prepared to go into a sketchy basement and be forced to drink some shit as a PC ADPhi- Be prepared to give up facebook, your razor, some laundry/clothing, and east campus KA- Be prepared to be woken up a lot in the early morning. Also heard something about some KA bros having to kill something years back, but I\’m not sure what or if I heard it out of context with regards to pledging and if it was some lab or something, but that was three years back or so. SigChi- Be prepared to stand in a room for hours against a wall and have to listen to an annoying song ^ Those are things I\’ve seen and heard first and second hand from fraternity members and guys who dropped pledging. Not sure what still happens, but that stuff is pretty recent, unless people like to lie about their pledging, but almost all of that stuff was seen and heard first hand. Two of them were told to me by someone\’s roommate and one of them was told to me by someone who dropped pledging. everyone gets driven out places, everyone gets woken early everyone is forced to drink in sketchy basements, everyone gives up some of their clothes, and everyone has line ups in a room for hours. none of those are exclusive to any one frat. sorry freshmen. Not everyone has to drive to VMI for one night and get in a conflict with police with trespassing. Not everyone has to give up facebook and not go on east campus for months. Well, lets think this through. The top frats\’s cool kids are boarding school WASPs who have abandonment issues. So they fuck their pledges up with alcohol and leave them stranded much like themselves during their freshman year at Andover or wherever. And they make you walk all the way back which will probably take you 2 hours minimum considering you\’re pretty fucked up and in the middle of nowhere. Whoever made this initial post is a fucking joke. I hope my fraternity gives you a bid so I can make your life fucking miserable. Pledging has so much value. If you haven\’t gone through it then you couldn\’t understand, but without pledging the entire fraternity system would be a shell of itself. Also nobody in any fraternity should be talking about their hazing rituals to anybody not in their fraternity. The fact that some of this shit is out there and actually posted on this site is not only disgraceful to those fraternities who let it get out, but also a major liability for all of greek life. The duke administration would love to shut down the greek system and talking about actual hazing on the public forum (however unlikely it might be that duke sees this at takes action) is stupid. If your a freshman and want to have an awesome social life at duke and want to make best friends for the rest of your life then you should join a fraternity. Pledging should be an afterthought unless your parents will take you out of duke if you score below a 3.5 during a semester. For me, the inappropriate photo thing is a redline. I don\’t mind getting naked, especially to play hide-the-weeny, but I don\’t want to have to live my life worried that a pic of me in a line up will surface when I can least afford it. I haven\’t heard of any fraternities taking naked photos of people. Nobody wants to see your package and fraternity members don\’t want to get sued for blackmailing you with naked photos. Chill out bro. lmao. Look at the guys at the top frats SNU, adphi and KA. A lot of pussies in these frats. A high majority of them are Nerds who have have learned to emulate from the cool high school kids on how to behave in general. On the inside, a lot of them are just pussies. If you have a car, you will be a bitch and drive people to places. So hide your car away if you don\’t want to be a bitch and if you don\’t want to clean up all the throw up in your vehicle by yourself. Also prepare to do some drugs. SNU specializes in cocaine is all I can say. True story. Be prepared to line ups and workouts, but I guess thats expected. A few years ago there was a lawsuit after one frat threw freezing water on some guy and he needed medical attention. Also didn\’t Ksig kill a guy because they transferred him from hot water to the freezing cold outside? Or something like that? Oh and Pikapp makes you drink your own cum. If you\’re a freshmen in this thread: you don\’t know anything even if you think you do. If you\’re a brother in this thread: I\’m sure you\’re already away at how much all of this is bullshit; don\’t fan the flames. If you\’re a girl in this thread: you don\’t understand pledging anyway. I mean if I was treated as subhuman for a semester by some kid a year or two older than me I\’d probably find some way to justify it as well. Not a psych major but there are a lot of studies about environmental factors leading to a change in mindset, Stanford prison experiment, for example, and it seems pretty evident that if you spend all your time with people that have convinced themselves that pledging is great and necessary, you\’d think so too. Not sure how many of you came into duke thinking that getting pissed on by your future brothers in front of girls and having to crawl through broken glass was worth it and you\’d still be able to keep your self-respect. Notice how none of the worst shit happens in the first week or two of pledging, otherwise kids would drop. It\’s called anchor bias kids and it\’s not rational. Well, there might be things for which I\’d trade in my self-respect, being able to go to some parties with a bunch of high school losers isn\’t one. Anyway, I\’m a senior, had friends in frats, went to their parties when I wanted to/wasn\’t imposing, dated/hooked up with hotter girls than anyone who posts regularly on acb. Someone forwarded me this thread, I think it\’s hilarious, if I were in a frat I\’d give that freshman a bid no question. By the way, my friends in \”top frats\” all think pledging is stupid, hate the sociopaths in their frats who are into hazing. You have defied biology. You are literally a walking, talking, breathing human vagina. I drove past a gay parade earlier today and yet you are still the biggest flamed I\’ve seen. Look at this kid guys he dated and hooked up with super hot girls!! Chugging vinegar happens in like every frat, adphi literally beats the shit out of their pledges, couple years ago ATO made their pledges get naked and crawl around in front of girls while the brothers pissed on them, same pledge class had to get on their hands and knees and crawl through broken beer bottles, a couple years ago some kid pledging my frat had a peanut allergy, a brother tricked him into eating a peanut, he went into anaphylactic shock, sure there\’s more shit as far as sexual stuff that they make you do as well. Ok ok fair, adphi beats their pledges, but the pledges still get to maintain bowel control...semantics. If you pledge adphi you will be physically assaulted, just not in the face, and you won\’t die (at least not from the beating-cold water bath tho...) Whoever wrote this is a complete liar. First off, no \”top frats\” would let a GDI come to there big parties. Second, as somebody actually in a \”top frat\” I would say that 90% of my fraternity believes in the importance of pledging and the people that don\’t are the ones who pussied out during the entire process and therefore alienated themselves from the fraternity. Pledging isn\’t about making kids miserable or getting drivers and cleaners, it is about bringing a pledge class together and helping them get to know the kids in the fraternity. Pledging brings us all closer together (and thats not a metaphor for gay shit). Third, if the greek community is high school losers then the GDI\’s like you are the kids who ate by themselves and never had a single friend. Fourth, the girls at duke aren\’t hot anyways so don\’t think your cool for hooking up with a duke 7. Fifth, I feel bad for you that you think joining a frat means trading in your self respect goddamn girl, you sound like every other cunt in the top sororities. Without new member education (a.k.a hazing), there would be no Greek parties at Duke. The amount of cooperation and responsibility it takes a group to put together any major party or philanthropy, regardless or relevance, is a product of the accountability and respect that members of an organization have for each other. Most things in new member education have a purpose. So if you\’re a freshman, shut the fuck up and just rush with one goal: finding a group of people that you enjoy being around. hahahahaha implying someone would actually reveal the pledge class that they\’re in and then shit on their own pledging and say that sororities have it right. holy shit dude try to be at least a little believable when you make up who you are. How\’s it feel to have made an active choice to take the four years of what could have been your social and sexual prime and intentionally waste them because you couldn\’t handle being \”shit on by a couple years older guys\”? I mean, it\’s really gotta suck for you. These are the absolute prime years of your entire life and you just voluntarily (unless you didn\’t get a bid, which I\’d believe) threw them out the window. You think it\’s this easy to party and get laid post-grad? No shot. No wonder you\’re so bitter as a gdi. Pretty sure the workforce can plan events without hazing. I mean their parties might not be as cool, but Wayne seems to be able to organize shit without having their buttholes penetrated by their \”older brothers\”. Also, the kids that are cool and get laid here are athletes and fratstars that see their frats for what they are: organizations that throw parties and have a percentage of cool guys and some absolute fucking flamers that post on anonymous gossip forums defending hazing. As an athlete, if any of you tried to get in my face and defend hazing for your fucking lame ass frat or call me a gdi, I\’d laugh in your ugly fucking face, and you\’d walk away because you\’re a pussy that gets no pussy and jacks off to frat rankings on this stupid website. Freshmen, have some self respect, don\’t let a bunch of sociopaths a couple years older than you make your life miserable so you can hang out with a bunch of high school losers that never got invited to parties before duke. Athletes haze freshman almost as much as frats you fucking dumbass. So either ur lying about being an athlete or your team is a bunch of pussies. First of all, you don\’t know shit about what athletes do, and second, hazing in the context of a team or the military is completely different-being made to do push-ups by some overweight fuck with a beer gut so I get invited to party with a bunch of my \”brothers\” who are all fucking losers is pathetic. This doesn\’t go across the board, athletes in some frats (adphi and dsig) get a sweet deal, but they also shit on the other kids in the frat because they know there are only a handful of cool non-athletes. My argument was from the beginning that hazing for a frat is stupid \”try to defend hazing for your lame frat, I\’d laugh, whatever\”. You can read it again, it\’s still there. You responded by saying that athletes haze too, which is only tangentially related to my point. I agreed that this is the case and said that this doesn\’t invalidate my argument since hazing for teams and the military isn\’t unnecessary and pathetic like it is for frats, and I\’d still laugh in your ugly fucking face if you tried to defend pledging as necessary. So, my argument never changed, you\’re still fucking stupid. But hey, congrats on all-city bro, too bad it must\’ve been a shitty fucking city or else you could\’ve played in college, something that\’s been an invaluable part of my college experience. And yeah, congrats too on being a fucking groupie, I probably know you in real life and I\’ve probably made fun of you, unless you\’ve been too busy sucking athlete dick for me to notice you. ADPhi traditionally has been known for having a very specific wealthy, Northeastern, WASPy feel with a high percentage of the brothers coming from certain specific boarding schools and playing on the lacrosse team. In recent years however, there has been gradual erosion of both this identity (due partially in part to changing admissions standards to Duke) and quality within the fraternity as a whole. There are now visible contingents of wealthy minorities and internationals. This on top of the lack of coherent housing has seen increasing numbers of brothers who feel detached from the fraternity and only maintain their affiliation for the social perks and it shows. Nonetheless, their parties have remained the premier social event at Duke; if they can maintain the quality in that sense, being on campus will usher in a new era of growth. Living together and mixing with sororities could strengthen the fraternity in many aspects, but the draconian requirements for their recognition might see them kicked off once again on the back of a lackluster year of social events, putting them in a very difficult position for years to come. KA has superficially maintained their identity more successfully than any other fraternity perhaps, but an emphasis has to be put on the superficial. As a group, they seem at first glance to dress and act in ways largely indistinguishable from fraternities at any large Southern school. But, on closer examination their pro-Confederate revisionism, subtle references to their wealth, conservativeness, drawls, racism and elitism seems a tad too calculated. Added to this are a number of white Northerners who are deliberately pushed to conform to this ideal during pledging, and which they often do over enthusiastically. However, with the advent of TFM as a social model in the eyes of both Freshmen and girls, and given their strongly established social presence, it´s tough not to see them maintaining their position arguably at the top for years to come. Otherwise known as Sigma Jew, they complete the trifecta of the three opposed stereotypes of the top tier fraternities. Often hailing from Long Island or ´The City\’ they are generally wealthy, and, well, like people from that area. But don´t worry, if you do enough coke and are enough of a superficial social climbing elitist you could fit in; as they are certainly more inclined to take individuals who don´t fit the necessary \’stereotype\’ in comparison to the above two fraternities. This is probably a reflection of the fact that SNu comes off as the most secure of their own identity out of the above three, but at the same time their desire to be edgy and diverse (to an extent) has somewhat backfired with some legit weirdoes being let through the cracks in recent years. Oddly enough, maybe due their generally average body frames and rampant meterosexuality and the subsequent lack of intimidation they wield, they fly somewhat under the radar and manage to exist absent the bitterness fueled vitriol directed towards many of the fraternities both above and below it. And then there was the rest. DSig is in essence the eclectic dumping ground of all the kids who didn\’t quite make the cut at the above three fraternities. In years past this was less evident and bolstered by a strong athlete presence, but this year´s pledge class was reflective of the slow downward trend the fraternity has been taking. Just as the TFM trend has helped KA legitimize itself as the ideal of fraternity life, this has worked to hurt DSig´s credibility. Furthermore, more stringent academic standards have also lowered the number of jersey chasers admitted each year and by extension the appeal of many of its members. Easily the most socially (yes they have gays) and politically liberal out of Tier 1, you´ll find a lot of kids from California, Miami, communist occupied Europe, and even some darker skinned brothers (literally). It will be interesting to see how they change going forward especially given the recent surge of both Pike and PiKapp. Are you a somewhat cool, somewhat good looking, somewhat athletic probably white guy from an insignificant part of American suburbia? That´s Pike in a nutshell and in many ways the reason for its recent success. Unlike the groups above, Pike comes without the pretension and need to conform to a certain identity. Free of such constraints Pike has simply been bidding the coolest kids they can find, regardless of background. Throw in the self-assuredness of not having to project an artificial image at all times, the monetary flexibility of numbers, a few slightly better than expected pledge classes, a distinct lack of the asshole vibe which comes with individuals who think they´re top tier, and you´ve got a solid group of guys that are attractive to girls and who are in the fraternity because they legitimately want to be there. They´re represented by a wide swath of white guy stereotypes, generally leaning towards vaguely athletic, vaguely stoner-esque, vaguely preppy and with a significant EDM undercurrent. Hopefully their recent social rise won´t go their head and ruin what might objectively be the best fraternity to be in right now at Duke. And no, I´m not in PiKe. At this point last year ATO would have arguably been a better fraternity than PiKe, at this point this year they are without argument slightly below them. In many ways ATbrOs are the guys who were too nice and lacking in confidence to get bids to KA/SNU/AdPhi, but in terms of background represent an amalgamation of all of them. Still, white, upper middle class and above and athletic is going to generally be a recipe for success and social legitimacy on any campus. Recent social probation and lack of visibility outside of their section hurt them hard this year during rush, and they ended up having to snap bid a number of kids who two years ago would have gotten nowhere near a bid. A symptom of the lack of confidence, or maybe some other more subversive currents within the fraternity (you know what I mean), is that many of brothers are content to just chill in their section. But at the same time, they are probably one of the closest brotherhoods and certainly still very popular with girls across the spectrum. It´s worth noting that at this level we start to notice the ´friends of kids we want to bid, who will join us as a group´, and with this pledge class especially there is a drop in quality of the individuals within the organization. Easily the greatest success story on campus, PiKapp would have struggled to be mentioned on this list as recent as 5 years ago. The formula was simple, bid as many people as possible, advertise aggressively to freshmen and throw the best parties your numbers can afford. Once you have the numbers, bid every friendzoned nice guy you can find. Once you have girls coming to all your parties because you´re non-threatening, you now have social status and you can now become more selective. Every year PiKapp´s pledge class has improved, and there is no reason for this trend to stop. Placed in an almost ideal social position, they mix with the greatest number of sororities out of any fraternity. And girls equal social currency. They are increasingly moving towards pledge classes with a profile akin to that of ATOs (athletic and white, although often times played pussy sports such as soccer in high school). PiKapp (especially their junior and sophomore classes) are becoming a legitimate social force, and slowly shedding their nice guy image much to the delight of the somewhat sexually frustrated sorority girls who they´d been hanging out with. It´s worth noting that politically and socially they are distinctly liberal (they bid two black gay kids…in the same pledge class), but are really just another one of those fraternities without really a defining stereotype. If PiKapp is a success story, KSig serves as a reminder of what can happen to even the most established of organizations. Off campus yet again, it seems only a matter of time before KSig goes the way of Beta and completely disbands. KSigs can generally be identified by a vaguely Euro trash style crossed with the unavoidable influence of prep which pervades every fraternity at Duke. Six or seven years ago KSig was the international fraternity representing an alternative stereotype to DSig/ADPhi/KA/SNu. Pay rolled by daddy´s oil money and dubious business deals in the 3rd world, they were known for throwing obscene parties, doing ridiculous amounts of drugs, and being a great time in general. Now you´ve got a few druggie white kids who might have been DSig but weren´t, and a cohort of weird sketchy international kids who struggle to communicate in English. They still have a few guys who are legitimately top tier material and who got duped into joining the fraternity by bygone seniors, but largely every pledge class has been going downhill and composed of desperate snap bids. Without housing and without an actual pledge program last year, the brotherhood will only depreciate further. However, even in their present state they still hold a certain amount of sway if only in the eyes of the older girls and who knows, maybe I´m wrong and we´ll see a resurgence in the coming years. SigEp operates largely as two fraternities, one with relatively cool PiKapp/ATO level kids (but with a somewhat inexplicable strain of tryhard frattiness; think Jewish kids from NY wearing Southern Proper frockets), and the another with kids who would be cool within the context of being in a SLG but are largely out of place and weird within the Greek scene both in terms of dress, socio economic background and attitude. A lot of SigEps are friendzoned hard much to their frustration, but nevertheless you will find relatively attractive girls at their pregames and mixers albeit only hanging out with the cool half of the fraternity. This year´s pledge class seems unlikely to upset the status quo and it seems unlikely that SigEp will be changing any time soon. Most of the members seem quietly comfortable with their relative social status and are fulfilled by the bonds of brotherhood that exists. There´s also rumors about a few gays kids within the fraternity so they´re open to that sort of thing apparently. A lot has happened to DTD in the last year and for it to even be on its feet as it finds itself today, is nothing short of a respectable accomplishment. After losing the majority of their members after the hazing incidents of two years ago, they went into last year with one goal in mind; numbers. Starting in the fall, they bid anyone and everyone who was vaguely cool and in the process ended up picking up kids from all across the socio-economic, ethnic and chill spectrum. Now, they have the numbers, a lot of legitimately weird kids but also a solid number of cool kids who´ll carry the fraternity. While there´s no single identifying feature that could be used to define this fraternity, they were all the same sort of kid freshmen year. They formed the core of the guys in the common room of whatever dorm they were in, went out in packs (with admittedly their female counterparts), mostly didn\’t get laid, but were nice fun guys in general you wouldn\’t mind your girlfriend hanging out with. In terms of quality of individual brothers, SAE is ahead of DTD and SigEp but as a collective can´t compete either with their numbers, or in terms of being socially established with sororities. Very conservative, in a lot of ways SAE represents the ´poor man´s KA´, or a group of vaguely Southern preppy tryhards who, without the social status of the later organization, scare girls away with their TFTC (too frat to care) belligerence and sloppiness. It is exactly this attitude that has unnecessarily scared away potential new members and held back their progress. Their somewhat successful method of snap bidding kids who got dropped from Tier 2, only perpetuates this image with new members overcompensating for their relative failure at rush. If only they stopped trying so hard, there certainly is a niche for them within the social scene especially with a large portion of the formally weird in high school Duke girls wanting nothing more than an ill-conceived stereotype to hang out with. With a core group of tight knit, and actually decent kids there is certainly potential for SAE to establish itself this year, however, they could very easily fade into irrelevance after their seniors, who make up almost half the fraternity, graduate. In a short and accurate summary, this is the average Jew frat. Below average height, curly hair, and above averaged sized noses are abound in addition to quirkiness and understated ambition. These are the smart Jews, whose fathers are well educated and relatively successful professionals but not quite rich enough (or perhaps too Jewish) to have sent their children to the schools which would have transformed them into the asshole frat stars of SNu. Seemingly content with remaining vaguely relevant, dressing in a laid back fashion with the odd unironed polo thrown in, and very much involved within the Jewish Student Association, these seem to be a bunch of nice, genuine guys with a strong brotherhood based on actual friendship who identify via a shared cultural background. There are some subtle under currents of wealth and their collective quiet ambition makes them very popular with their lady counterparts (the Jewesses who weren\’t quite bitchy, hot or rich enough to go Pi Phi) and they had been doing relatively fine until this last year. A lackluster pledge class filled with non Jewish snaps, a year spent losing ground socially, and abandoning the blue house means they´ve certainly regressed in the last year. But then again, they´ve survived persecution for thousands of years, I have no doubt AePi will bounce back this year and remain established as the Jewish enclave for those who seek it out for the future to come. If a fraternity wasn\’t listed above, quite simply it\’s because they are not relevant nor do they wield any significant power within the mainstream visible social scene. Lambda (the Asian fraternity) and the black fraternities do have sway within certain subgroups on campus, and legitimate brotherhood to boot, but they are largely self-contained. This is not to say that joining a non-listed Greek organization won\’t provide you with many benefits, simply that they do not provide any degree of \’social proof/legitimacy\’ in the eyes of the student body at large. well this was very obviously written by an adphi. its also one of the gayest things ive ever read. I actually think this was written by someone who wasn\’t top tier, because I doubt anyone in the first three or four fraternities would know enough about all of these others to write such an accurate analysis. I would guess PiKapp but who knows? I think the main point that OP makes which is actually pretty fair is a changing Duke demographic. A shift away from the stronghold WASP and southern university it used to be will naturally hurt organizations like ADPhi and KA while helping groups like Pike who go for the prototypical \”above average white guy.\” But in terms of actual rankings in order this is relatively accurate. This isn\’t twitter. Please spare us the hashtags.Why did \”key 3 who knows\” become a thing? Can we please let this die? The fact that you sucked a little more lesbian dick during rush does not give your opinion any more validity, nor do guys care what sorority you are.It is damaging for freshmen to get too caught up in the day to day back and forth of ACB, but in my opinion useful to have a thoughtful guide to the Greek system to steer them in the right direction. This is it. Largely accurate, surprisingly unbiased, and clearly demonstrates knowledge of prevailing trends and conventional wisdom on campus. OP says ADPhi\’s \”identity is eroding\”. This is half true. While they are struggling to keep getting super rich boarding school WASPs, this is more due to the fact that there are simply less of those kids than there were five years ago. Less kids who are just here due to $. So this part is true. What\’s not true is the argument that they are losing the lacrosse part of their identity. If anything that connection has really been strengthened the past year or two, with the two organizations hanging out a lot. While KA is definitely maintaining its southern style superficially, I don\’t think we\’re seeing MORE northerners than before. They\’ve always had a mix of both. The TFM rise in popularity just makes this more obvious as kids from NJ wear croakies/short shorts/etc. The main thing that makes DSig more \”diverse\” is their politics IMO. Duke greek life is pretty conservative and that manifests itself in the political opinions of the brothers. For guys who are looking for a more liberal perspective, you will find that Dsig\’s opinions are closer to that of the duke student body as a whole. I don\’t think that has changed much these past few years. Whats the general knowledge about SLGs. I heard Maxwell, Mirecourt, and Cooper were key three? Round table= losers. Lots of gays and strange kids. They have tried to work it out on the past - google \”Magnolia Conference\”. An athletic league with Duke, Vanderbilt, Rice, Emory... not a bad idea. One could add Georgetown and Virginia and it would be a hell of a league. Too bad it didn\’t work I guess Duke is kinda like Dartmouth. Except it\’s in a dumpy, redneck NC town and was founded with money that came from giving millions lung cancer. At least you have basketball. No wait... Didn\’t you guys just lose to Clemson? The point of the Ivy League conference was to hold athletes to high academic standards, which Duke does not do. Our athletes actually go to class and do not have tutors do their work for them. I also saw you guys just celebrated your fiftieth anniversary of allowing black students in the classroom. Lol. Not exactly something to be proud of guys... The Ivies have never been very egalitarian, but at least blacks have been receiving doctorates at places like Harvard and Yale since the 1870\’s. Dude, you obviously know nothing about Duke or Durham... Durham is decidedly not \”redneck,\” it is very urban in terms of its large impoverished population. Apart from that Durham has a vibrant and diverse community that includes NCCU and a unique proximity to UNC and NC State. You\’re probably just jealous that you picked some school like Cornell that shows up in the rankings lower than Duke but has none of the fun to show for it. And here\’s some knowledge to drop on you asshole, the Ivy League was founded purely as an athletic conference, that is the only reason you fuckers group yourselves together. You\’re \”supposed\” academic standards happened later when they decided not to award athletic scholarships at the schools. Yes, Duke lost to Clemson, but it really is a shame that the Ivy League celebrates every time they win an NCAA tournament game. And regardless, we still have one of the best basketball programs of all time. People go to our basketball games. And now our football team is a relative success as well. And the athletes go to class, and have strict guidelines for graduation and retention, many are better than your athletes in terms of success after college. And for your information, the desegregation of Duke happened so late because the school is in the SOUTH. Nobody is proud of it, but there we\’re still bullshit Jim Crow and literacy tests and all. At the time is was a great move, and I\’d rather celebrate it than not celebrate it. And the Ivy League holds its athletes to academic standards more so than Duke? How many Harvard athletes got kicked out for cheating with that whole scandal? Oh right, picked some real winners there. If you\’re upset because Dartmouth is more of an isolated hellhole than Duke don\’t take it out on us. Us and Stanford will enjoy being academic powerhouses with elite athletics, you can continue to flounder in your relative lack of success on the field and your miserable existence off it. How on Earth do you, New York/New Jersey/Connecticut, white privileged Jewish kid in any way feel oppressed at this university?? Is it the massive Palestinian protests on the main quad? Is it the KKK rallies in the BC? Is it because Durham is the most redneck, republican part of North Carolina? Literally the worst people at Duke (so of course they are anti-semitic but don\’t take it personally--they hate everyone who isn\’t exactly like them). This is an anonymous message board whose sole purpose is to make other people feel like shit. The ACB community probably also kicks puppies and drunkenly urinates on old ladies when it\’s not on the computer.";
